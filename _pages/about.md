I am a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am a part of [HPArch](http://comparch.gatech.edu/hparch/) research group, advised by Dr. [Hyesoon Kim](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hyesoon/). My research focus has been on 3D-stacked memories, processing in memory (PIM), and GPUs. Before pursuing a doctoral degree, I worked at startups as a software engineer (2007-2010) in fulfillment of military service. After joining Georgia Tech, I worked at Sandia National Laboratories as a research intern (2013) and AMD Research as a co-op engineer (2015-2016). I received my B.S. degree from Seoul National University in electrical engineering and computer science (2012).
